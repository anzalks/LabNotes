To enable this module, follow these instructions.

1. Upload it to your sies/all/modules folder and enable it on the admin/build/modules page.

2. Install mimetex.cgi

In order to use the ASCIIMath and ASCIIMathCharmap, you will need to download the appropriate Mimetex binary and install it on your server (usually just uploading it to the cgi-bin directory of your website is sufficient on a Linux server).

The binaries are available from http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html, where some instructions can be found on the syntax of the derivative of TeX that this filter is using.

Copy one of available mimetex.cgi (one appropriate for your server's OS) into wysiwyg_asciimath/mimetex.

3. Test your mimetex.cgi by visiting this URL (where example.com is your website):
http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/wysiwyg_asciimath/mimetex/mimetex.cgi?(a+b)
You should see a valid image with the formula (a+b)

Depending on your server configuration, you may need to place CGI files into different location, such as .../public_html/cgi-bin.

You also need to make sure that mimetex.cgi has executable permission set. Consult with your ISP on how to do it.

In some rare cases you may need to compile mimetex.cgi from source on your server. Your ISP may be able to assist with it.

4. Make sure that the paths in admin/settings/wysiwyg_asciimath are configured for the mimetex.cgi on your server.

5. Test that svgimg script is working by visiting this URL (where example.com is your website):
http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/wysiwyg_asciimath/svgimg/svgimg.php?sscr=-3,3,-2,2,.5,1,1,.5,1,500,200,func,cos(x*pi),null,0,0,,,black,1,none,func,sin(x*pi),null,0,0,,,blue,3,none

Note: SvgImg Requires GD2 and Freetype for full functionality

6. Configure one of your WYSIWYG profiles to show TinyMCE buttons:
 - ASCIIMath
 - ASCIIMathCharmap
 - ASCIIGraph

7. Make sure that the input filter you configured in the WYSIWYG profile allows <img> and <embed> tags.

8. Verify that TinyMCE shows the new buttons when you edit a page using your WYSISWYG profile, and these buttons work.
